January 4th 2025
    New year! It went so fast. Coffee and code got moved due to guests but making some efforrt today to do some so with Salithox. I am still enjoying learning more about styling so not much content up yet.

January 10th 2025
    Coffee and code is my favorite.

January 17th 2025
    Coffee and code again &lt;3 I'm slacking. Been browsing other wonderful sites and enjoying harassing my unoffical and reluctant IT team.

January 24th 2025
    Coffee and code time. Not many updates that are visible. I still want to add a cute cusor, not sure what yet. Still overthinking what I want to do lay out wise but enjoing grid-ception. Need to add the reading log, and read more in general.

February 14th 2025
    Coffee and code. Starting working on sewing pages again.

February 28th 2025
    Coffee and Code. Still need to make all my changes live. Still a mess of code. Had help lazy adding cursor sparkles. Will need to credit proper.

April 3rd 2025
    How is it April already? Moved coffee and code to Thursday this week.

April 18th 2025
    Coffee and Code. Fixed a few typos. So much work to do here. I need to figure out where I am going go back to basics maybe.

April 25th 2025
    Left work early so got to go to coffee and code a bit earlier. Goat had me walk thru a test site using html with inline css. He keeps showing me the same things and I hope he knows how appreciated he is. His help did indentify some issues with heirarchy and may have been interchangably using body and main. They do not work like that. I did a few changes after on my own. Site is still a broken mess but slowly improving. Keeping his napkin note in my laptop still as a reminder.

April 26th 2025
    More impromptu coffee and code.

May 1st 2025
    No coffee and code this week due to other plans so hijacked date night. Not sure I will get much done. Might try again in a few days. About and Staff links are broken (again? still?). Adding to the fix list. 
    
    The broken links are randomly working again. I changed nothing. 

May 3rd 2025
    More coffee and code. Goat got to join us. We're all chatting a bit more then doing the things tho.

May 16th 2025
    Coffee and code.

June 24th 2025 
    Missed some coffee and code, missed logging a few. Starting playing with borders while I decide how I want to fix things. Fianlly added the page to credit sources. Woo. Fixed some things but being recomend to burn it down. Good thing I like fire.
