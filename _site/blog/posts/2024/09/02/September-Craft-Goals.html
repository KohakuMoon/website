<p>September Craft Goals</p>

<p>Quilting and Sewing
    Queen of Diamonds: Wrap up lingereing month 7 and continue to month 8</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mini Maker Station: Make and add binding

Hold Tite Folio: Make and add binding

Pattern out new quilt start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Crochet
    Bags: Weave in ends for taupe and succulent. Finish Ecru squares. Attempt assembly and straps on taupe.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Cardigan: Decide on adding rows. Possibly make sleeves 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Bonus Crafty
    Stream project: Restart crochet scarf
    Figure out tatting idea
    Push out spinning another month
    Move flower decoration out untill new blanket is made</p>

<p>Productivity was slow but marching forward. Added a new blanket project. It will take some upfront work but hopefully will come together quickly as a gift. Maybe will post after it is gifted. Ended working on more squares instead of finishing a bag and on the cardigan. My gauge is off and I need to decide on adding rows and see how it will affect the sleeves. I mostly skipped it last year but in the past have Streamed most days in September. Goal is to go back to that, use it as motivation to both stream and keep my crafts progessing. I plan to keep working website and code improvment also.</p>
