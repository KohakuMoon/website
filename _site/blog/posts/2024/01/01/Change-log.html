    A site is up. More Coffee is needed

May 1st 2024
    Went through some tutorials. Asked questions to my unoffical IT team. Took all day but more is up. Much coffee was had. Step nine of tutorial will be next while deciding where to go from here.

July 8th 2024
    Fixed some typos and removed test post. Had some trouble adding a new post but it appears I miss created the file? Deleting and remaking seems to have fixed the problem.

August 5th 2024
    Added craft goals for this month. Have been attempting to work on page here and there. Salithox and Goat helped my quited a bit. Goat is the master missing dash finding VIP. Long story short, there is a page for authors, some test stuff in a sewing category. I plan to spent more time this month making some stylistic choices and getting some of my thoughts live.

August 11th 2024
    Started playing with colors. Not sure why the gradient is repearting, and a bit different on each page also. Will review again tomorrow. Goat will is saved needing a newspaper for the moment at least. 

August 12th 2024
    Unoffical IT team helped me get some color up. Salithox helped get me started and then Goat walked me through some more. The backgroud color gradient is not longer repeating. The lighter main color is added in the code as well. I still have a bit of a disconnect, but, I feel my understanding has improved. I am lucky to have such great support people and am greatful for their help. I still have some work in adding colors and want to reorganize pages and navigation a bit. 

August 15th 2024
    I actually have enough coffee for this. I have had so much coffee recently. I can not remember the fix Goat shared for my gap issue, ~~adding padding-top: 1rem; seems to have worked~~. I will have to study more on this. The number is arbitrarily chosen and assume it may all change later.

    Goat chimed in. Margin 0. Salithox played with margin block auto for same effect. Interesting.

August 16th 2024
    Playing with borders a little and color in navigation a bit more. 

August 17th 2024
    Took several days and more effort this morning but have lost hope of old laptop as portable code practice box. I absolutly did not have the footer in the html when playing with it yesterday. And it apparently need text. More learning might allow it to be a bar of color but good with some '~~~' in the moment

September 20th 2024
    Uploaded the September craft goals I wrote earlier in the month. I now want to add a sparkly cursor, possibly future update.

December 18th 2024
    Learning grid and breaking things. Eventually I will move past the same few questions I keep asking the unoffical IT team. 

December 20th and 21st 2024
    Two days of coffee and code &lt;3 Still breaking things and toying with grid. The blog posts are so broken. Slowly getting the hand of grid-ception at least. I have the best un-offical IT team.  

December 24th 2024
    Escaped the house pre holiday plans for coffee. Looking at Tufte CSS project again and with Goat's help added the files to play around with. Note to self, add proper source page in footer later. 

December 27th 2024
    Coffee and Code. No wifi, playing with line breaks and stuff. 

December 30th 2024
    More coding and coffee with the unoffical IT team. They are slowly convincing me to try coding by hand. Small changes so far. More div containers. All the div containers.

2025

January 4th 2025
    New year! It went so fast. Coffee and code got moved due to guests but making some efforrt today to do some so with Salithox. I am still enjoying learning more about styling so not much content up yet.

January 10th 2025
    Coffee and code is my favorite.

January 17th 2025
    Coffee and code again &lt;3 I'm slacking. Been browsing other wonderful sites and enjoying harassing my unoffical and reluctant IT team.

January 24th 2025
    Coffee and code time. Not many updates that are visible. I still want to add a cute cusor, not sure what yet. Still overthinking what I want to do lay out wise but enjoing grid-ception. Need to add the reading log, and read more in general.

February 14th 2025
    Coffee and code. Starting working on sewing pages again.

February 28th 2025
    Coffee and Code. Still need to make all my changes live. Still a mess of code. Had help lazy adding cursor sparkles. Will need to credit proper.
