    A site is up. More Coffee is needed</p>

<p>May 1st 2024
    Went through some tutorials. Asked questions to my unoffical IT team. Took all day but more is up. Much coffee was had. Step nine of tutorial will be next while deciding where to go from here.</p>

<p>July 8th 2024
    Fixed some typos and removed test post. Had some trouble adding a new post but it appears I miss created the file? Deleting and remaking seems to have fixed the problem.</p>

<p>August 5th 2024
    Added craft goals for this month. Have been attempting to work on page here and there. Salithox and Goat helped my quited a bit. Goat is the master missing dash finding VIP. Long story short, there is a page for authors, some test stuff in a sewing category. I plan to spent more time this month making some stylistic choices and getting some of my thoughts live.</p>

<p>August 11th 2024
    Started playing with colors. Not sure why the gradient is repearting, and a bit different on each page also. Will review again tomorrow. Goat will is saved needing a newspaper for the moment at least.</p>
