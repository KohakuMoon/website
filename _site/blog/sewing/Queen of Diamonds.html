                    <br>
                    <p>Added a few more of the mick jaguar borders. Decided on on backing fabric also! Bought so much fairy flake. Greywork was announced this month but decided the darker fairy flake wouldn't not be as nice for this quilt.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Worked on mick jaguar borders some more at a sewing social for completing projects.</p>

                <li>January 2025
                    <br>
                    <p>Cut the strips for the fairy flake. Using a proper sewing table made it go so fast! I need to invest in one in the future. Attempted to cut corner stones. Opted to use my ruler while has one 60 degree line. I asked for a second opionion at the sewing night and they said it looks right. A few more to cut and will be working on sewing on the mick jaguar border. </p>
