    A site is up. More Coffee is needed</p>

<p>May 1st 2024
    Went through some tutorials. Asked questions to my unoffical IT team. Took all day but more is up. Much coffee was had. Step nine of tutorial will be next while deciding where to go from here.</p>

<p>July 8th 2024
    Fixed some typos and removed test post. Had some trouble adding a new post but it appears I miss created the file? Deleting and remaking seems to have fixed the problem.</p>
