    Coffee and code time. Not many updates that are visible. I still want to add a cute cusor, not sure what yet. Still overthinking what I want to do lay out wise but enjoing grid-ception. Need to add the reading log, and read more in general.

April 25th 2025
    Left work early so got to go to coffee and code a bit earlier. Goat had me walk thru a test site using html with inline css. He keeps showing me the same things and I hope he knows how appreciated he is. His help did indentify some issues with heirarchy and may have been interchangably using body and main. They do not work like that. I did a few changes after on my own. Site is still a broken mess but slowly improving. Keeping his napkin note in my laptop still as a reminder.

    More impromptu coffee and code.

May 1st 2025
    No coffee and code this week due to other plans so hijacked date night. Not sure I will get much done. Might try again in a few days. About and Staff links are broken (again? still?). Adding to the fix list. 
    
    The broken links are randomly working again. I changed nothing.
