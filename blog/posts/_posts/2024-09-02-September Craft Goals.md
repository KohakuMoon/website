<div>
<br>
Productivity was slow, but, marching forward. Added a new blanket project. It will take some upfront work but hopefully will come together quickly as a gift. Maybe will post after it is gifted. Ended working on more squares instead of finishing a bag and on the cardigan. My gauge is off and I need to decide on adding rows and see how it will affect the sleeves. I mostly skipped it last year but in the past have Streamed most days in September. Goal is to go back to that, use it as motivation to both stream and keep my crafts progessing. I plan to keep working website and code improvment also.
