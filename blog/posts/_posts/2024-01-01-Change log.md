    A site is up. More Coffee is needed

May 1st 2024
    Went through some tutorials. Asked questions to my unoffical IT team. Took all day but more is up. Much coffee was had. Step nine of tutorial will be next while deciding where to go from here.

    Fixed some typos and removed test post. Had some trouble adding a new post but it appears I miss created the file? Deleting and remaking seems to have fixed the problem.

    Added craft goals for this month. Have been attempting to work on page here and there. Salithox and Goat helped my quited a bit. Goat is the master missing dash finding VIP. Long story short, there is a page for authors, some test stuff in a sewing category. I plan to spent more time this month making some stylistic choices and getting some of my thoughts live.

    Started playing with colors. Not sure why the gradient is repearting, and a bit different on each page also. Will review again tomorrow. Goat will is saved needing a newspaper for the moment at least.

    Unoffical IT team helped me get some color up. Salithox helped get me started and then Goat walked me through some more. The backgroud color gradient is not longer repeating. The lighter main color is added in the code as well. I still have a bit of a disconnect, but, I feel my understanding has improved. I am lucky to have such great support people and am greatful for their help. I still have some work in adding colors and want to reorganize pages and navigation a bit.
