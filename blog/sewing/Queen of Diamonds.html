                    <p>Cut the strips for the fairy flake. Using a proper sewing table made it go so fast! I need to invest in one in the future. Attempted to cut corner stones. Opted to use my ruler while has one 60 degree line. I asked for a second opionion at the sewing night and they said it looks right. A few more to cut and will be working on sewing on the mick jaguar border. </p>
