                        <p>I worked on hat and seam ripping my mistakes on that. Assembling the half square triangles is my homework for next sewing group meeting. Was fun looking at all the fabric for it.</p>

                        <p>Pulled this out to take with to sewing group tommorrow. I had been waiting until I finished Queen Of Diamonds thus the long gap of no work on it.</p>
