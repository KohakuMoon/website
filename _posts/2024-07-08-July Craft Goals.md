Ended up skipping goals post for June and update on May. I did complete all of May's goals, minus the streaming part. I also stalled on the mini maker station. The desk was tidied at least. Now the unending clutter that is my desk needs another visit. I also plan to waste some time enjoying Monster Hunter in between crafting and reading.
